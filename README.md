# AWS SAM: Serverless Application Model

## What is SAM?
 - previously known as Project Flourish
 - extends AWS CloudFormation 
 - provide a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by a serverless application.

## What is serverless computing?

 - allows to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers.
 - Serverless applications don't require you to provision, scale, and manage any servers

## Benefits of serverless computing?

 - No server management
	. There is no need to provision or maintain any servers. There is no software or runtime to install, maintain, or administer. 

 - Flexible scaling
	. Your application can be scaled automatically or by adjusting its capacity through toggling the units of consumption (e.g. throughput, memory) rather than units of individual servers.

 - Automated high availabilty
	. Serverless applications have built-in availability and fault tolerance. You don't need to architect for these capabilities since the services running the application provide them by default.


## SAM CLI
 - SAM CLI is a tool that allows faster, iterative development of your Lambda function code. 
 - Allow deployment from a terminal
 - Allow local testing
